    "question": "What is cpp?",
    "answer": "cpp is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp002",
    "question": "What is the difference between C and cpp?",
    "answer": "C is a procedural programming language, while cpp supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. cpp allows the use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which are not available in C."

    "topic": "Cpp",

    "question": "What are the basic data types in cpp?",
    "answer": "The basic data types in cpp include: int (integer), char (character), float (floating-point), double (double-precision floating-point), and bool (Boolean value)."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp004",
    "question": "What is a pointer in cpp?",
    "answer": "A pointer in cpp is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers allow for dynamic memory allocation and can be used for arrays, structures, and objects."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp005",
    "question": "What is object-oriented programming (OOP) in cpp?",
    "answer": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) in cpp is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes. The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp006",
    "question": "What is a constructor in cpp?",
    "answer": "A constructor in cpp is a special member function of a class that is executed when an object of that class is created. Its purpose is to initialize the object."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp007",
    "question": "What is the difference between a class and a struct in cpp?",
    "answer": "In cpp, the primary difference between a class and a struct is that, by default, members of a class are private, while members of a struct are public. Both can have member functions, constructors, and destructors."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp008",
    "question": "What is polymorphism in cpp?",
    "answer": "Polymorphism in cpp allows a function or method to behave differently depending on the type of the object it is acting upon. It is achieved through function overloading and virtual functions."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp009",
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'new' and 'delete' operators in cpp?",
    "answer": "'new' is used to dynamically allocate memory on the heap, and 'delete' is used to free that memory. These operators are essential for managing dynamic memory in cpp."
  },
  {
    "topic": "Cpp",
    "id": "cpp010",
    "question": "What is the Standard Template Library (STL) in cpp?",
    "answer": "The Standard Template Library (STL) in cpp is a collection of template classes and functions that implement commonly used algorithms and data structures, such as vectors, lists, queues, and maps."
