            <h4 className="fw-bold">The power of Spaced Repetition</h4>
            <p>
              At Memora, we incorporate the Spaced Repetition technique, a
              scientifically-backed method that optimizes learning and
              retention. Spaced repetition involves reviewing information at
              increasing intervals over time, which strengthens memory retention
              and minimizes forgetting. Rather than cramming all the information
              in one go, spaced repetition ensures that you revisit concepts
              just before you are likely to forget them, making it more
              efficient than traditional study methods. This technique is built
              into Memoraâ€™s learning system, helping users retain and recall
              information effectively. By intelligently adjusting the intervals
              between reviews, Memora allows learners to focus on their weaker
              areas while reinforcing their strengths. This method has been
              shown to significantly enhance long-term memory retention, making
              it a powerful tool for mastering complex concepts. Whether you're
              preparing for exams, trying to learn a new programming language,
              or staying up-to-date with emerging tech trends, Memora and spaced
              repetition can transform your learning experience and help you
              achieve your goals faster.
